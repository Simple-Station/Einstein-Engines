  ## Background Information
  To sum them up briefly, Xelthia are a species that have only had their first contact with humans around 25 years ago. They tend to be foodies, and generally aren't huge fans of wasting things, going as far with it as to often eat their own deadâ€” though cooked of course. Xelthia generally tend to fall into two camps; those who are extremely driven to do things and accomplish their own goals, and those who just blend in with the crowd, sometimes lacking a drive to do much more than simply work as a janitor.
  
  [color=#878787](More in-depth lore is to be written at a later date, though some details include that they're originally from a swamp planet and the specific year of their first contact is likely around 2424. This existing summary will stay regardless for those who aren't as interested or are in a rush.)[/color]
