# Patches

Patches are a simple and effective way to slowly administer medication to a patient without risking an overdose.
They can be made with the medfab and filled with the chemmaster. They can be directly applied to a patient and will fall off by themselves once empty.

There are 5 types of patches:
- Basic
- Rapid
- Prefilled
- Large
- Makeshift

### Basic
The basic patch holds 40 units of chems and transfers 1 unit at a time.

### Rapid
The rapid patch holds 40 units and transfers chemicals twice as fast.

### Prefilled
Some medkits contain prefilled patches. These hold 30 units and transfers 0.25 units per second. They cannot be filled or emptied

### Large
The large patch holds 60 units and transfers them one unit at a time. 
However the large patch also transfers 15% of its chemicals upon use (10 units if full)
=
### Makeshift
The makeshift patch can hold 15 units and transfer 1 unit every 2 seconds.
However it can be crafted by hand and filled manually without a chemmaster
