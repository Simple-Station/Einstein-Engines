Mind Breaking is the act of permanently destroying an individual's link to the no√∂sphere, and as such is considered by space law to be an act equivalent to Murder. It is NOT the job of any individual
on the station to go about mind breaking all psionics, such a thing must not be taken lightly and should only be performed under extreme circumstances. Once mind broken, an individual loses an essential
spark of humanity, making it so that for the rest of their natural life, they can never again be a psychic. In some cases, mindbroken individuals cease to have any personhood at all, becoming completely non-sentient.

Mind Breaking is performed by either imbibing a pill of Mindbreaker Toxin, or an injection of Soulbreaker. It is to be performed only as an emergency measure during a Code White situation, and only with
the permission of the station's Commanding Officer. Mind Breaking may also be given by the station's Commanding Officer as a Capital level punishment for the most egregious crimes, such as using psychic
powers to commit heinous acts.
