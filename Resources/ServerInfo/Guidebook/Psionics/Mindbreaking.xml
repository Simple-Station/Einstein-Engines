Mind breaking is the act of permanently destroying an individual's link to the no√∂sphere. Such an action is considered to be equivalent to attempted murder in most civilized systems, due to the extremely deleterious effect such trauma can have on the psyche and brain matter of the victim. 
Incidents of mass mind breaking typically have similar hallmarks to those of serial killings, or mass killings; with the perpetrator usually subscribing to an extreme ideology when interrogated by the authorities.
  
Mind breaking is performed by either imbibing a pill of Mindbreaker Toxin, or an injection of Soulbreaker. It is to be performed only as an emergency measure during a Code White situation, and only with
the permission of the station's Commanding Officer. Mind Breaking may also be given by the station's Commanding Officer as a Capital level punishment for the most egregious crimes, such as using psychic
powers to commit heinous acts.
