## Biology

[color=#a88b5e]Physical Appearance[/color]

Shadowkin typically have dark fur covering their entire body with rare exceptions applying.
Their fur typically comes in black, dark grey, and deep purples but some shadowkin have been seen to have fur as white as the fresh snow.
Shadowkin also have long talons on their hands and feet, capable of rendering flesh from the bone with ease. 
Along with all of this, they have fleshy tails covered in fur that can range from long and fluffy to short and coarse and everything in-between.

The two most notable features that shadowkin have are their large eyes and the four ears on the top of their head which typically make them stand out in even the largest crowds.
Their large ears help them with understanding and speaking their telepathic language of Empathy, a sort of hivemind that they all use.
The upper two ears, from what we can gauge, are responsible for transmitting the thoughts of shadowkin to other shadowkin.
This is in contrast to their lower two ears which are used to receive these messages and translate them for each individual shadowkin.
It is unclear how they work together but experiments have revealed that without all four ears intact, the entire system falls apart.

The large eyes of shadowkin have been seen to glow in the dark, the eye seemingly entirely made up of the iris without a noticeable pupil.
It is currently unknown how they see through these large eyes as they do not seem to change, but it is known that they seem to have improved night vision that's superior to that of other species'.
It's also to be noted that their large eyes seem to be more akin to two glowing orbs rather than proper eyes that a normal species would have, being a rarity and a desirable items for collectors, taxidermists, as well as other individuals who engage in black market and backroom deals. 

[color=#a88b5e]Mentality[/color]

The mentality of shadowkin is typically mirrored by their eyes, different colors of their eyes meaning different things. 
There are rare exceptions for this with shadowkin having different personalities than their eyes reflect but this is typically seen as more of a shameful birth defect than something that would be celebrated.
The eye colors that we know of that are possible are blue, red, yellow, green, purple, orange and black eyes.
These eyes may be solid colors, lighter or darker hues, and in rare cases they may have heterochromia which typically results in shaming from their society, friends, and other people in their lives.
Blue eyes denote shadowkin that are curious and eager for knowledge, typically they are those that are most likely to engage with outsiders and non-shadowkin.
Red eyes are those who are determined to reach a goal, not shying away from confrontation to reach it, often seen by others as violent and loose cannons.
Yellow eyed shadowkin are very cautious, unlikely to engage with non-shadowkin, preferring to stick to the dark and shadowy places sooner than go out into the light and expose themselves.
Green eyes mean they’re eager for knowledge but more reserved and cautious, sometimes seen acting through proxies rather than actively interacting with non-shadowkin themselves.
Purple suggests they’re eager learners who are willed to seek out knowledge more directly than others, being the complete opposite of green as they're often determined to go straight to the source rather than being satisfied with second-hand accounts or knowledge.
Orange-eyed shadowkin are traditionally reserved people who pursue their goals from hiding but will fight when cornered, they're often seen with a small and tight clique of trusted acquaintances who they act through rather than show their face in public. 

Black eyes are shadowkin that have been disconnected from the Dark for whatever reason, they are shunned by all but the most forward-thinking shadowkin as a result.
The closest equivalent for black-eyed shadowkin is organics who have been mindbroken, their souls having been torn out of their bodies and the Dark long since having left them.

## History

[color=#a88b5e]Home Dimension[/color]

It is known that shadowkin are native to a dimension called "the Dark" with not much else known about their native dimension because of their hesitancy to speak about anything regarding it. 
We do know that the Dark is something of a shadowkin hub where they can go to other dimensions, albeit after having to recover their energy for decades as dimension travel takes a long toll on them.
What we do know about the Dark is that it's a place devoid of all light and air, seeming to have no pressure either. 
We also know that all shadowkin are born in the Dark and that it's where they go in order to give birth how animals on earth do.
It is also suspected that the Dark is the physical manifestation of the nöösphere but that is currently unconfirmed as we don't know enough about either to make an educated decision.

## Culture

[color=#a88b5e]Language[/color]

We are only aware of the spoken language of the shadowkin which is Marish, typically consisting of the "mar" sound along with slight variations in order to produce different words.
Some common sounds alongside "mar" that have been observed are also "war" and "lmar" or "lwar" amongst other sounds that are used to combine to make words and a functioning language for shadowkin.
Attempts have been made to record and play back Marish for research purposes but attempts have so far been unssuccessful for unknown reasons.
When attempting to play back Marish, the recording seems to come out odd and disjointed without the intricacies of the original MArish that it was recorded from.

[color=#a88b5e]Naming Conventions[/color]

Shadowkin largely have two schools of thought when it comes to naming their children, both equally popular and common in our dimension as well as back home from what we were able to glean.
Above all else, shadowkin typically only have a single name with a second name only being appended by a tribe elder upon the completion of a task that is monumental or otherwise heroic.
Regardless of what school of thought shadowkin subscribe to, their names are typically given to them by their mother except in cases which the mother dies during childbirth which is when the father will give the shadowkin their name.
Traditionalists are the first school of thought when it comes to naming shadowkin, they believe that names should be in Marish and have unique meanings like those that are normal amongst humans.
A name that would fit the traditionalist view would be Maaarlwarmar which means "first beginning" or "genesis" because they were the firstborn of their mother.
Conversely, there is the worker school of thought who believe that the names for shadowkin should reflect their designated job in a tribe or a society.
Names can be as simple as those such as "Baker" or "Hunter" which are quite obvious to those which are obscure such as "Ash" or "Ember" for engineers.
Traditionally, names like these are given at birth because that's what the tribe has already determined them to be as that is what the need will be by the time they grow up. 
There is a more modern subsect of the worker school that is primarily composed of young shadowkin eager for change in their society, they have elected to choose their own jobs and as such ther own names despite being the vast minority & often looked down upon.
Finally, there is the more liberal school of thought which believes that shadowkin should adopt names that reflect the popular culture of the dimension that they belong to. 
These shadowkin are a vast minority in our dimension and in shadowkin society as a whole so they are extremely few and far between as a result.
