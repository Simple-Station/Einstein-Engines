## Biology

[color=#a88b5e]Physicality[/color]

Shadowkin seem very similar to canine species when looked at.
While mammalian in nature, it is nearly impossible to find any sexual dimorphism between genders, if they even have any.
They seem to all share the same body shape and often voices.

The head consists of a snout with a nose, sharp teeth in the mouth, and two big ears on top of the head.
In addition to the two big ears, Shadowkin have two smaller ears lower down, giving them an exceptionally good ability to detect where exactly sounds come from.

Shadowkin eyes are usually very large and fully mono-colored; they have no discernible pupils, irises, or similar.
The eye of a Shadowkin is a solid orb of color and, perhaps, their most defining trait.

All observations show Shadowkin do not seem to age after a certain point.
Some may look older or younger than others, but the aging process seems to stop when the Shadowkin is chronologically in their 20s.

Unusually, compiled medical data on Shadowkin shows that they have no lungs, thus not needing to breathe.
The compiled medical data also shows that they have a large, more circular shape where their lungs would be.

[color=#a88b5e]Mentality[/color]

Shadowkin core personalities are mirrored by their eye color.
Some common colors and their meanings are:

- Red: Determined to reach a goal, even if it means sacrificing others.
- Green: Eager to learn and fit in with others.
- Blue: Very calm and collected, or shy.

Other colors also exist in addition to these but are not as common.
The other colors are just mixes of the three main colors.
For example, here are a couple of mixes:

- Purple: Determined, yet probably won't harm, in some cases shy.
- Yellow: Quite eager to be number one, especially if related to knowledge.
- Orange: Shy and calm, yet will fight if provoked.
- White: Very robust, exceeds expectations in most things they do, but is quite boring to interact with generally.

There are rumors other colors exist as well.
Shadowkin that lose their ability to travel between dimensions have [color=#000000]black eyes[/color] no matter their core personality.
These black-eyed Shadowkin make up the largest number of them living in Realspace.

## History

Shadowkin are creatures native to their so-called Pocket Dimension, a part of space that is unable to be accurately pinpointed and/or visited by most people.
From there, Shadowkin visit our worlds, and sometimes a large number of them are forced into our world in mass migrations and then live among us.
What exactly causes these mass migrations is unknown, but may be related to them losing their ability to travel between dimensions.

[color=#a88b5e]Homeworld[/color]

While no home system or world has been found, some Shadowkin talk about dreaming of their homeworld, describing a lush and green land with abundant resources.

[color=#a88b5e]Racial/Government Status[/color]

There currently exists no Shadowkin government, and with Shadowkin being as rare as they are, they tend to fit into currently established societies and civilizations, with varying degrees of success in the past.
In recent years, however, many cultures have taken to accepting Shadowkin as another galactic constant, going as far as allowing them lives similar to those that any of the other species would lead.

Some systems early on took and experimented on Shadowkin, in an attempt to utilize their powers in various technology, and even recreating them with very experimental technology.
The tests failed and this was met with a lot of resistance from Shadowkin, many of them being killed or becoming Blackeyes in the process.
After this, those systems realized that Shadowkin were a sentient species, and deeply apologized for their actions.

## Culture

[color=#a88b5e]The Typical Experience[/color]

Most times, life is pretty normal. A Shadowkin can have a job, go to the job to work, then spend time off with friends.
The fact is most times of the day, the small abilities one might have are nice, but not overly useful. Sure, a Shadowkin could dim the nearby lights, but at the same time, the Shadowkin could also just flick the light switch.
However, it can sometimes happen that when a Shadowkin slept in and needs to get to work quickly, they might just teleport to work.
Some people might be overly wary of Shadowkin, some might be drawn towards Shadowkin.
Many Shadowkin are used to not wearing clothes, which can lead to some awkward situations, but those are generally the same situations any other furred species would have.

[color=#a88b5e]Language[/color]

The only recorded spoken language of the Shadowkin is an unusual language named "Mar", named after the fact that every single word in this language is the word "mar".
Spoken in different tones, with more or less emphasis on the various parts, or by drawing out parts of this word, a multitude of different "mar"s can be created, but they follow no apparent conventions.
Shadowkin can perfectly understand each other though and discuss complex topics using only this one word.
The Shadowkin can hear the Mar language from anywhere and understand it via Empathy, yet do not know who it is from unless they are close enough to see the sender.
Other humanoid species are incapable of understanding or learning Mar, as they are unable to accentuate their speech in the same way or hear some of the silent, Empathic tones they use.
Shadowkin tend to learn one or more languages of the Realspace beings.
The capability in such learned languages depends fully on each single Shadowkin, where some have only very broken capabilities, while others are fluent in several languages.

[color=#a88b5e]Naming Conventions[/color]

Shadowkin tend to name themselves with a singular word, ranging from states of being, such as Lone and Collected, to words that describe their memories connected to their supposed homeworld, like Dreamer.
Name schemes of the humans are usually frowned upon, as they do not reflect upon the Shadowkin, resulting in reactions ranging anywhere from an actual frown to being entirely ignored.
Shadowkin following another species naming scheme are often Blackeyes, not fitting in with other Shadowkin as well.
Names hold a great deal for Shadowkin because of how closely they are often tied to describing who they are.
Following life-changing events, Shadowkin often change their names to reflect the new person they have become.

[color=#a88b5e]Rumors and Speculation[/color]

Shadowkin are beings from another dimension, capable of performing feats that others could only describe as "magic", with no scientific explanation.
It is speculated that Shadowkin actually have a whole nation in their dimension, and those that come to Realspace just simply refuse to talk about it.
Sometimes Shadowkin mention a "Hub", acting as evidence for this theory.

Some believe Shadowkin are the result of experimentation, though them being taken and experimented on is a large piece of evidence denying this theory.

Some believe Shadowkin are the result of an expedition crew that disappeared hundreds of years ago, even though the first Shadowkin sightings were long before that.
Obviously, this expedition ship performed time travel.

## OOC Notes

Extra information, should be read if playing Shadowkin, if not you should try to learn this in gameplay.

[color=#a88b5e]History[/color]

Shadowkin used to live on a very lush forest planet, using primitive technology to work with metal, create tools, and build stone structures.
According to the dreams, Shadowkin back then had forged tools and blades, but had no electricity, presumably putting them at a medieval technology level.
In a sudden event, everyone and everything organic suddenly found themselves in an alternate dimension, sucked straight out of their previous home.
The Shadowkin being ripped from their homes happened in three total "dimensional ripples".

Now stuck in this alternate dimension, Shadowkin changed a lot.
They stopped aging and with time developed the ability to use the energy of this dimension to power their unusual "magic".
And even later, they learned how to leave the dimension and travel to Realspace and back again.
However, as the eons passes, memories became shady of their home.
Many Shadowkin forgot more and more about the thousands of years they had lived, reducing memory to focus on the more important closer time.
However in dreams, Shadowkin, even those born in Realspace, often have visions of their home planet.
Some events can trigger certain memories to return like meeting someone they knew from the past makes them remember in great detail who they are.
As such, it can happen that two Shadowkin can randomly meet and remember that they met hundreds of years ago, often confusing nearby unknowing humanoids.

[color=#a88b5e]Biology[/color]

If a Shadowkin personality changes drastically, their eye color will change as an effect, reflecting upon their new personality.
Shadowkin, being ageless entities, can look older or younger, but that is merely a visual representation of how they feel about their age.
22 years after birth a Shadowkin stops aging, and in all of their history no instance of them dying of old age has been recorded.

[color=#a88b5e]Shadowkin energy[/color]

Shadowkin have an odd organ in them, their "Core".
This organ is the source and storage place for their power.
Without it, they would be unable to use their abilities.
The Core is very sensitive to physical trauma, yet is very resilient to electrical or magical damage.
The Core can get irreversibly destroyed from overloading it, using too much power too quickly, which is what happens to the Blackeyes.
The Core can not be replaced, using a new one would require a new body, and trying to use another Shadowkin Core will result in death.

The Shadowkin's ability to fall into a deep sleep is a method to recharge their energy at a significantly higher rate than idling.
Though while in this deep sleep, it is difficult to wake up, and cannot be woken up by anything other than themself.

Shadowkin can know exactly how much energy they have, and feel differently based on how much they have.
They can also Empathically sense the energy of others nearby and can estimate how much energy they have based on their feelings.

[color=#a88b5e]Shadowkin Abilities[/color]

Shadowkin have a few abilities.
They can teleport, requiring a small amount of energy, but they can do it quickly.
They can teleport to and from The Dark, requiring much more energy than teleportation.
They can immediately fall into a deep sleep at any time.

[color=#a88b5e]The Ritual[/color]

When a Shadowkin reaches adulthood, they undergo a "Ritual".
During this Ritual they intentionally overload their energy reserves, forcing their capacity to expand rapidly in order to gain enough energy to travel between dimensions.
Most Shadowkin pass the Ritual and that's the end of it, but some Shadowkin perish or become Blackeyes during the ritual.

[color=#a88b5e]Important Terminology[/color]

[color=#a88b5e]Shadowkin:[/color]
The name given for your race.
While your race doesn't have a name for itself, this is how most of the Galaxy refers to you, so it's how you refer to yourself too.

[color=#a88b5e]The Dark:[/color]
The other dimension where you are from.
There are theories that The Dark and Bluespace are connected, but you don't know the details about that.
The Dark is a dimension where strange rules apply.
For outsiders who somehow enter it, whatever they imagine being in there, they see there, if not too complex.
If an outsider comes with a willing Shadowkin they may see what the Shadowkin sees, being anything they imagine, or a reflection of the station.

[color=#a88b5e]Blackeyes:[/color]
A Shadowkin who has undergone and failed the Ritual, or lost their ability via other methods.
The Blackeyes have completely black eyes, no matter their actual personality.
They choose a new name, which follows a favorite species' naming scheme.
They are often ignored or left alone more by other Shadowkin.
[color=#a88b5e]Note:[/color] Blackeyes correlation with black eyes is done entirely via roleplay, the game will not handle this for you.

[color=#a88b5e]Mar:[/color]
A word used to verbally communicate feelings, emotions, wishes, hopes, ideas, and whatever, in addition to your Empathy.
