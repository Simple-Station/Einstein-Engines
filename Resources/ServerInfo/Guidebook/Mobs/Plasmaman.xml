  # Plasmamen

  They breathe plasma, and oxygen is highly toxic when inhaled.
  Being exposed to oxygen sets them on fire.

  To prevent ignition, they wear sealed suits made up of an envirosuit (in the jumpsuit slot) and an envirosuit helmet.
  Other suits like EVA suits, vacsuits, tacsuits and hardsuits will also seal them from oxygen exposure.

  They don't experience hunger nor thirst.
  They don't have blood and cannot bleed out.

  They can consume Milk to gain a positive moodlet and slowly heal Brute, Heat, Shock, and Caustic damage.
  They can also consume Plasma to gain a bigger positive moodlet and heal almost every damage type faster, except for Cellular.

  They infuse their fists with plasma dust that combusts when they punch, dealing [color=orange]5 Heat[/color] and [color=red]2.25 Blunt[/color] damage. However, each successful punch deals [color=orange]1 Heat[/color] damage to their hands.

  Plasmamen with the traits [bold]Claws[/bold], [bold]Talons[/bold] or [bold]Natural Weapons Removal[/bold] have less unarmed damage but don't take self-damage from unarmed attacks.

  They take [color=#1e90ff]15% less Slash and 25% less Piercing damage[/color],
  and are [color=#8658fc]immune to Radiation and Cold damage[/color],
  but take [color=#ffa500]50% more Blunt and 50% more Heat damage[/color].

  Due to their [color=#8658fc]Cold immunity[/color], they can live in cold environments such as Glacier Station without the need of a winter coat.

  All Plasmamen start with an envirosuit, an envirosuit helmet, and a plasma internals tank.

  Their envirosuits contain a [color=#1e90ff]self-extinguisher[/color] with limited charges, which they can activate when they are on fire
  and wearing their envirosuit helmet. The self-extinguisher needs to recharge between uses.

  Their envirosuit helmets are [bold]spaceworthy[/bold] and provide a flashlight and welding protection.
  However, they cannot eat nor drink without taking off their envirosuit helmet.

  The plasma internals tank lasts roughly an hour before needing to be replaced or refilled.

  ## Medical Treatment

  Before performing surgery on a Plasmaman, their envirosuit needs to be unequipped first, which is disastrous in an oxygenated environment.

  To get around this, the Plasmaman can be buckled to a [bold]stasis bed[/bold] before removing their envirosuit
  to prevent them from self-igniting throughout the surgical procedure.

    Their envirosuit helmets prevents them from eating pills, but their envirosuits allow chemicals to be injected through them.
