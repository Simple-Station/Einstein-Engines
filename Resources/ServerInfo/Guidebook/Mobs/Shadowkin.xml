The origins of shadowkin are largely disputed among scholars as nobody really knows exactly where they're from, 
 only that they started appearing one day. What is widely accepted is that they're not from this universe, 
 this dimension, or this plane of existence. We know that they originate from a dimension they simply refer to 
 as "the Dark" with not much explanation other than that. They have several evolutions that have allowed them to 
 continue in the way they are currently. The chief theory is that shadowkin are beings created by the nöösphere and 
 that the Dark where they live is in fact the nöösphere itself but this theory remains hotly contested due to the implications.

Shadowkin in their current state are valued employees of Nanotrasen and often drift in and out of employment in other companies or sectors of space.
 They are generally known as reliable and trustable employees, not having anything that's exceptionally negative or positive regarding their work ethic.
 They have been known to be hired by security contracting companies and mercenary freelance organizations for their ability to go into the umbra at will.
 Anti-shadowkin sentiment is not very common among Nanotrasen employees but certain shadowkin that continue to interact with the nöösphere and cause problems 
 around themselves have the tendency to draw the ire of local authorities.
