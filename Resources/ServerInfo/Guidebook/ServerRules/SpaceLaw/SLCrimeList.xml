  ## Stackable Crimes: Crimes are to be considered ‘stackable’
  in the sense that if you charge someone with two or more different crimes,
  you should combine the times you would give them for each crime.
  Make sure you do not combine the same category of crimes, indicated by brackets.

  ## Crime Modifiers
  Crimes can be influenced by specific modifiers that adjust their severity, sentencing, or context. 
  These modifiers provide additional nuance to legal proceedings and ensure appropriate handling of offenses;
  Based on circumstances such as intent, danger, or external factors.
