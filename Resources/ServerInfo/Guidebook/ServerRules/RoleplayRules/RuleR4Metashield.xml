  # Roleplay Rule 4 - Do not metagame, obey the Metashield
  Something that is "shielded" cannot be known by your character during a round until the "revealing condition" happens. This also means that your character cannot do things based on "shielded" information. Knowing or acting on something that is shielded before the revealing condition is met is referred to as metagaming.

  Revealing conditions reveal the shielded information for the round, not for a specific instance. This means that once a revealing condition is met in a round, the shield no longer applies in any case for the remainder of the round.

  ## Never Revealed IC
  Some shields are never revealed IC. This means that your character can never act as if they know about that shielded thing.

  The following are shielded:
  - Current game mode and possible antags during the current game mode.
  - Events from previous rounds.
  - Events you experienced as a different character.
  - All information related to the player of a character rather than the character itself. (See "Metafriending and Metagrudging" below.)
  - All information gained while dead or a ghost.
  - All information gained while in critical condition or unconscious.
  - The fact that a round will end.

  This does not prevent knowing that a shift will end, but does prohibit things like preparing to kill people at central command when roleplay rules stop being enforced on LRP.

  ## Nuclear Operatives

  Nukies are considered propaganda by Nanotrasen, and crew isn't informed on them at all.
  Posters seen on-station are ignored and called syndicate propaganda.

  The fact that the nuke disk must be protected and could be used by a bad actor to try to destroy the station is not shielded.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - discovering a nuclear operative's shuttle
  - an operative name
  - a War Ops announcement
  - being a nuclear operative

  ## Changelings

  In the eyes of the public, changelings are an exterminated predatory lifeform and their potential existence on the station is shielded.
  This metashield prohibits players from crew bloodtesting until the metashield is revealed.

  Knowledge about the abilities of changelings is not shielded.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - discovering a hollowed body
  - witnessing changeling use their non-stealth abilities (not stings or passive abilities)
  - witnessing someone trying to absorb a body
  - witnessing someone changing their appearance
  - being a changeling

  ## Heretics

  To normal people, heretics are generally unknown. Security and Command may be aware that a group of people following a rogue god exists, but it's an absurd reality.
  This metashield prohibits normal players from knowing what runes or reality fractures are. Security may be suspicious of them.

  Knowledge about the ability of heretics is not shielded.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - witnessing a crewmember drawing a rune
  - witnessing a crewmember harvesting a reality fracture
  - witnessing a crewmember using their powers

  ## Devils

  To most ordinary people, a Devil is a fake fairy tale made to scare people from talking to strangers.
  This metashield prohibits players from knowing that a player is a devil from their equipment alone, although they may distrust them as much as they wish.

  Knowledge about the abilities and consequences of a Devil deal are not shielded.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - You are a Devil.
  - You are the Chaplain, a lawyer, or a member of Central Command. (Including BSO and NTR)
  - You have made a deal with the Devil.
  - You have witnessed someone make a deal.

  ## Zombies

  Zombies are known galaxy-wide, but not as real-life, instead, as fiction.
  Nuclear Operatives and Syndicate Agents are aware of Romerol and what it can do, but are prohibited of speaking about it publicly - unless they want their families to die.

  Revealing conditions to the "Zombie" Shield:
  - You are a Nuclear Operative
  - You are a Syndicate Agent
  - You are a Zombie
  - You have seen Zombies on the station

  ## Infections

  Zombies are known as extinct, they previously ravaged humanity hundreds of years ago in medieval times.
  A cure was made, and is still held onto by chemists and Chief Medical Officers as a show of how long your family has been in the field.

  Revealing conditions to the "Infections" Shield:
  - You are a Chemist
  - You are a Chief Medical Officer
  - Zombies are announced to be real and station-wide

  ## Deathsquad

  Deathsquad is known to exist - per the posters on the station, but they are not known as a crew killsquad, instead known as an elite team sent into stations to handle extreme threats even the best of ERT Security leaders could handle.
  The station's Nanotrasen Representative and Blueshield Officer are aware that Deathsquad is a crew killsquad, but are heavily prohibited to mention it, and will be dealt with after, or during, the shift.

  In private conversations, faxes, or phone calls, both BSO & NTR are advised to use the term 'Janitor Squad' to refer to the Deathsquad.
  Crew can also choose to roleplay as if they've seen deathsquad movies, knowing limited aspects of their gear one would reasonably know watching an action-movie.

  Revealing conditions to the "Deathsquad" Shield:
  - Code Omicron is called, nuking the station
  - Code Epsilon is called, terminating contracts
  - You are the Nanotrasen Representative (NTR)
  - You are the Blueshield Officer (BSO)
  - A Central Command Official (Non-NTR/BSO) mentions Deathsquad as a [bold]Killsquad[/bold]

  ## Implanted Implants

  Implanted implants are shielded.

  Implanters themselves and un-implanted implants are not shielded. This prohibits implant checking.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - discovering a non-NT implanter, used or unused
  - discovering a non-NT implant box
  - discovering use of a non-NT implant by anyone
  - experiencing a situation where absolutely no other explanation is possible
  - discovering an unlocked uplink

  ## Chameleon Items

  Chameleon items are shielded.

  Being suspicious of an item being fake or stolen is not shielded, but testing items or calling them chameleon is covered by this shield.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - seeing someone else cause any chameleon item to change
  - finding holographic nanomachine fibers
  - experiencing a situation where absolutely no other explanation is possible
  - discovering an unlocked uplink

  ## Stealth Items

  The fact that an item can be something other than what its visual appearance and examine description indicate is shielded.

  This shield protects stealth items, including protecting them from being tested.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - seeing the item behave differently than the expected behavior for the item
  - seeing the item used for its hidden purpose
  - experiencing a situation where absolutely no other explanation is possible
  - discovering an unlocked uplink

  ## Metafriending and Metagrudging
  This section provides additional information on a concept that is prohibited by multiple metashield items that are never revealed IC. Giving a person or character preferential treatment based on something that your character should not know is considered metafriending. Treating a person or character negatively based on something that your character should not know is considered metagrudging.

  ## Metafriending Examples
  These are all examples of things that are prohibited by at least one metashield item that is never revealed IC.
  - Giving a character additional access or a job because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Trusting a character because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Not fighting a character because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Ignoring your objective to kill a character because your character and theirs became friends in a previous round.

  ## Metagrudging Examples
  These are all examples of things that are prohibited by at least one metashield item that is never revealed IC.
  - Not giving a character additional access or a job because you are mad at or don't like the player who is playing that character.
  - Not trusting a character because you are mad at or don't like the player who is playing that character.
  - Starting a fight with a character because of something that they did last round.
  - Starting a fight with a character because they killed you while you were playing a different character.
  - Targeting or harassing a character based on anything which that character did outside the current round.
  - Targeting or harassing a character based on anything which the character's player did while not playing the character.

  ## Explicitly Not Shielded
  The following is a list of things that are explicitly not shielded. If something is not on this list, it doesn't mean that it is shielded, but if something is on it then it definitely is not shielded.
  - The fact that the nuke disk must be protected and could be used by a bad actor to try to destroy the station.
  - Items that are of high value or are desired by the Syndicate, and therefore are likely targets of theft.
  - The idea that any Syndicate agent or other bad actor has goals or objectives that they are attempting to accomplish.
  - The number of goals or objectives that a Syndicate agent or other bad actor has.
  - The fact that the Syndicate are enemies of Nanotrasen, and that they regularly attempt to send covert agents to spy on, sabotage, or attack Nanotrasen.
  - A character's typical appearance. Though you should keep in mind that multiple characters can share the same name.
  - The fact that the Syndicate have covert items capable of getting items to them, and that these items are known as uplinks.
  - Wizards are not metashielded as the wizards federation is well rumoured about.
