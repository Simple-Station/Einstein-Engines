  # Traitors

  - A Traitor is an antagonist employed by the Syndicate. They have access to various Syndicate tools and weapons through their [color=#a4885c]Uplink[/color].
  - Traitors can use codewords to identify themselves to one another in order to cooperate.
  - In a Traitor round, any player can be a Traitor aside from department heads, the captain, or any security officers.
  - Traitors should focus primarily on completing their objectives successfully by the end of the round.

  Traitors are antagonists employed by the [color=#ff0000]Syndicate.[/color] You are a sleeper agent who has access to various tools and weapons through your [bold]uplink[/bold].
  You also receive [bold]codewords[/bold] to identify other agents, and a coordinated team of traitors can have [italic]brutal results.[/italic]

  Anyone besides [textlink="department heads" link="Command"] or members of [textlink="Security" link="Security"] can be a traitor.

  ## Uplink & Activation
  The [color=cyan]uplink[/color] is your most important tool as a traitor. You can exchange the 20 [color=red]telecrystals[/color] (TC) you start with for items that will help you with your objectives.

  By pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenCharacterMenu"][/bold][/color], you'll see your personal uplink code. [bold]Setting your PDA's ringtone as this code will open the uplink.[/bold]
  Pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenCharacterMenu"][/bold][/color] also lets you view your objectives and the codewords.

  If you do not have a PDA when you are activated, an [color=cyan]uplink implant[/color] is provided [bold]for the full [color=red]TC[/color] price of the implant.[/bold]
  It can be accessed from your hotbar.

  [bold]Make sure to close your PDA uplink to prevent anyone else from seeing it.[/bold] You don't want [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] to get their hands on this premium selection of contraband!

  Implanted uplinks are not normally accessible to other people, so they do not have any security measures. They can, however, be removed from you with an empty implanter.
