  Beware! A [color=#a4885c]MindShield Implant[/color] will prevent the implanted person from being converted into a revolutionary. Assume all of [color=#a4885c]Security[/color] and [color=#a4885c]Command[/color] are implanted already.

  ## Revolutionary

  A [color=#ff0000]Revolutionary[/color] is the result of being converted by a [color=#5e9cff]Head Revolutionary[/color]. Revolutionaries are underlings of the Head Revolutionaries and should follow orders given by them and prioritize their well-being over anything else, because if they die, you will lose.
  Keep in mind that you can't convert others as a regular revolutionary, only your boss can do that.

  ## Objectives

  You must eliminate, exile or arrest all of the following Command staff on station in no particular order.
  - Captain
  - Head of Personnel
  - Chief Engineer
  - Mystagogue
  - Logistics Officer
  - Head of Security
  - Chief Medical Officer

  Remember, your objective is to take over the station and not to destroy it so try to minimize damage where possible. Viva la revoluci√≥n!
