character-item-group-TraitsCasterType = Psicaster Type

trait-name-LatentPsychic = Latent Psychic
trait-description-LatentPsychic =
    Your mind and soul are open to the noosphere, allowing for use of Telepathy.
    Thus, you are eligible for potentially receiving psychic powers.
    It is possible that you may be hunted by otherworldly forces, so consider keeping your powers a secret.
    Latent psychics have no special abilities, modifiers, or unique features compared to other psions.
    However they can become more or less anything given time and resources.

trait-name-PsionicInsulation = Ï‡ Waveform Misalignment
trait-description-PsionicInsulation =
    You are a flesh automaton animated by neurotransmitters. Within your skull lies a
    1.5kg sack of meat pretending at sentience. By modern epistemiological theory, you aren't even a sophont.
    The good news is that you are immune to most positive and negative effects of psychic powers.
    There may be other consequences to this malady.

trait-name-Elementalist = Elementalist
trait-description-Elementalist =
    'Elementalists' are a rare and modern form of Psion, noted for their potential for bombastic feats of "Kinesis".
    So rare were these individuals, that at one point in time they were known by titles such as Sorcerer, or Magician, if they weren't a charlatan that is.
    As an Elementalist, your talent for developing new powers is severely limited.
    Yet despite this tradeoff, your powers are more exclusively the realm of flashy and dangerous. You will never generate any powers known as "Mentalics".
    You are almost certainly going to be hunted. Let others know what you can do at the peril of your very soul.

    - You can never "roll" new powers. The powers you buy at character creation are all you will ever have.
    - Your available powers are strictly limited to "Kinetics".
    - You will never be Telepathic.

trait-name-PsychoHistorian = Psycho-Historian
trait-description-PsychoHistorian =
    Psycho-Historians are a fairly common and well-studied branch of psionic users, whose powers are documented in the public domain
    as far back as the 1970s on Earth. Mythological accounts of such individuals can also be traced back thousands of years. Today,
    Psycho-Historians make up the overwhelming bulk of the Epistemics Cult's awakened members. Your powers are generally regarded as "Safe", as they
    exclusively interact from one mind to another without need of interacting with extra-planar forces. However, you will never be able
    to learn any powers known as "Kinesis".

    - Your powers are developed at a significantly faster rate than other psychics.
    - Your available powers are strictly limited to "Mentalics"
    - You are automatically considered Telepathic.
