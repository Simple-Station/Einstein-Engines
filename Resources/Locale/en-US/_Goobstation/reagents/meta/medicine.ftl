reagent-name-monover = monover
reagent-desc-monover = Relatively low complexity anti-poison drug that stops working in impure environments. Its side effects can be potentially used to quickly verify whether bloodstream is clean of chemicals.

reagent-name-synthcells = synthcells
reagent-desc-synthcells = Artificially produced "cells" that quickly destroy and replace any dysfunctional cells. Works both through external and internal application. Works on dead.

reagent-name-salicylic-acid = salicylic acid
reagent-desc-salicylic-acid = Powerful healing agent, excelling at restoring most mangled of corpses. Difficult to overdose.

reagent-name-oxandrolone = oxandrolone
reagent-desc-oxandrolone = Gelatinous chemical that heals burn damage faster the more burnt patient's body is. Difficult to overdose.

reagent-name-pentenic-acid = pentenic acid
reagent-desc-pentenic-acid = Multipurpose drug, works against poisons and prevents radiation damage from all but strongest sources.

reagent-name-atropine = atropine
reagent-desc-atropine = Shuts down many body functions to safely heal any damage to patients in critical condition. Best used outside of combat situations due to severe mental impairment it causes.

reagent-name-calomel = calomel
reagent-desc-calomel = Quickly binds with chemicals and removes them from bloodstream. Keeps patients in near-death state, and as such should only be used as a supplement.

reagent-name-ammoniated-mercury = ammoniated mercury
reagent-desc-ammoniated-mercury = Difficult to use but potentially powerful drug with a niche specifically in fighting toxins. Flushes poisons, and will quickly heal any poison damage if patient is not damaged externally. Using it on injured patients is ill-advised, though the drug will retain its toxin-flushing capabilities.

reagent-name-antihol = antihol
reagent-desc-antihol = Quickly neutralises any ethanol in the solution, while healing most prolific drunkards.

reagent-name-ibuprofen = ibuprofen
reagent-desc-ibuprofen = Weak drug that helps with headaches and returning to medical bay after a bad day.

reagent-name-silver-sulfadiazine = silver sulfadiazine
reagent-desc-silver-sulfadiazine = Soothing liquid that can be applied externally to quickly treat mild burns. Toxic when in bloodstream. Works on dead.

reagent-name-styptic-powder = styptic powder
reagent-desc-styptic-powder = Vibrant powder that can be applied externally to quickly treat mild bruises. Toxic when in bloodstream. Works on dead.

reagent-name-tehifin = tehifin
reagent-desc-tehifin = Low potency burn medicine of questionable safety.

reagent-name-ebifin = ebifin
reagent-desc-ebifin = Extremely strong burn compound with cripplingly low overdose threshold. Reacts violently in bloodstream, quickly healing most burn injuries when used in low amounts.

reagent-name-procenyl-lazide = procenyl lazide
reagent-desc-procenyl-lazide = Somewhat strong brute medicine with low overdose threshold, needs to be crystalized at low temperatures and separated out from its precursor solution.

reagent-name-bozaide = bozaide
reagent-desc-bozaide = Slow acting brute medicine, deals low amounts of radiation damage.

reagent-name-genecide = genecide
reagent-desc-genecide = Blows genetic damage away, literally. Make sure to monitor patients taking it.

reagent-name-procenyl-lazide-sludge = procenyl lazide sludge
reagent-desc-procenyl-lazide-sludge = Relatively easy to create solution, needs heating to bind properly in a notoriously inefficient reaction.

reagent-name-styptic-crystal-catalyst = styptic crystal catalyst
reagent-desc-styptic-crystal-catalyst = Staple of any school chemistry lab, this usually non-reactive liquid can mix with blood and sodium to produce beautiful crystals with healing potential.

reagent-name-synthflesh = synthflesh
reagent-desc-synthflesh = Whilst it's just seemingly uninteresting ground up synthmeat, cells with great healing potential can be separated from it. Synthmeat can be created from a somewhat complex reaction with hydroxide byproduct.

reagent-name-hercuri = hercuri
reagent-desc-hercuri = Strong coolant, both serviceable for internal and external application, though care must be taken not to freeze the patients too much.

reagent-name-herignis = herignis
reagent-desc-herignis = Can thaw out most chilled of lizardmen, recommended to only use in small doses, as it can quickly heat up its metaboliser to dangerous levels.
