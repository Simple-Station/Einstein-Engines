# Default barks. This file serves as a template for future bark types and as a fallback for mobs who do not have unique barks for one reason or another.

# Recommendations:
# - Try to keep barks simple and reasonably short. 8 words is the usual limit, but most barks should be at msot 3 words long.
# - Each bark should be one, or at most two sentences long.
# - Keep in mind that those will usually not be understood by players.
# - Do not add punctuation at the end of the message, except for question marks, so that the random bark system will add random punctuation.
