# Bloodred Modsuit
uplink-modsuit-bloodred-name = EE-99MS "Raider" Modsuit
uplink-modsuit-bloodred-desc = A mass production model of a modular-tacsuit that once made headlines for its showings in Solarian media. After being rejected in favor of the Shanlin tacsuit, these suits have mysteriously become commonplace among frontier pirate crews.

# Elite Modsuit
uplink-modsuit-elitemodsuit-name = EE-122MS "Jaeger" Modsuit
uplink-modsuit-elitemodsuit-desc = A mass production modular take on the Shiwei tacsuit. It trades a lot of the Shiwei's enhanced protection for modular equipment gear. Compared with the Jaeger modsuit, it offers unparalleled protection from energy weapons, but its ballistic protection leaves much to be desired.
