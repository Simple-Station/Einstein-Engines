trait-name-SiikMaas = Siik'maas
trait-description-SiikMaas =
    Siik'maas is theorized to be the ancient religious tongue of the Tajara, once universally shared among them.
    Though religious devotion waned over time, it became the lingua franca and remains the primary educational and most widely spoken language on Adhomai since the Migration Age.
    Humans can learn to speak Siik'maas, as it relies less on body language than other Tajaran languages, but biological differences make certain inflections and subtle movements challenging, often resulting in slower, imprecise speech.

trait-name-NalRasan = Nal'rasan (Tajara Sign Language)
trait-description-NalRasan =
    A body-focused language created by M'sai, Nal'rasan was developed to communicate discreetly between parties.
    Because the mrowling and vocal expressions of Siik'maas could sometimes alert prey to hunter presence and drive them away, hunting parties adopted this language to prevent such a thing from occurring.
    Rebel sects saw the use of this language and made use of it for covert discussions and the transmission of highly classified information before and during the Great War. 

trait-name-SiikTajr = Siik'tajr
trait-description-SiikTajr =
    Siik’tajr, unlike Siik’maas, is a modern language developed during the overthrow of the plutocracy to allow revolutionaries to communicate secretly.
    Combining Siik’maas with the body-language-heavy Nal’rasan, it gained prominence during the Great War for covert operations.
    While not commonly used in daily life due to its complexity, it remains a secondary language for many families with ties to the war.

trait-name-YaSsa = Ya'ssa
trait-description-YaSsa =
    Ya'ssa is a dialect of Siik'maas, widely spoken by Njarir Tajara.
    Presumed to be the traditional tongue of the nobility, it uses a more refined alphabet and speech pattern believed to have evolved from a less-used ancient dialect.
    Hadii members have been recorded to still use Ya'ssa, though ultimately with the widespread annihilation of noble families, this language has fallen into disuse until its revival by the New Kingdom of Adhomai. 

trait-name-Delvahii = Delvahii
trait-description-Delvahii =
    Delvahhi is a language closely related to the Zhan-Khazan Tajara.
    It is still widely used in religious ceremonies dedicated to Ma'take and amongst settlements comprised mostly of Zhan-Khazan.
    It is also the favored language of farmers, who have adopted it in the wake of government intrusions into the agricultural industry of Adhomai.
