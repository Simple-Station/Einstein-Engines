nationality_name_bieselite = Bieselite
nationality_description_bieselite = Citizens of the Republic of Biesel, a corporate-backed democracy at the heart of Tau Ceti. Their economy thrives on free trade, private enterprise, and the ever-present influence of NanoTrasen. While some enjoy the wealth and opportunity their home provides, others see them as little more than corporate serfs in a system built for profit.

nationality_name_solarian = Solarian
nationality_description_solarian = Citizens of the mighty Sol Alliance, the oldest and most powerful human government. Proud of their military tradition and vast territorial holdings, Solarians view themselves as the true inheritors of human destiny. While their influence reaches every corner of known space, many outer colonies struggle under the weight of centralised governance and rigid bureaucracy.

nationality_name_valyrian = Valyrian
nationality_description_valyrian = Hailing from the icy world of Valyrian 4b, these people have adapted to extreme cold, thin atmospheres, and harsh conditions. Their sprawling sky cities, built upon towering peaks, remain isolated from outsiders. Valyrians are known for their resilience and a cultural identity shaped by survival in one of the most hostile inhabited planets.

nationality_name_elyran = Elyran
nationality_description_elyran = Citizens of the Republic of Elyra, a rising power built on technological self-sufficiency and energy independence. Their economy flourishes on antimatter production, allowing them to resist corporate control where others have faltered. With a strong sense of national pride and a strict anti-corporate stance, Elyrans see themselves as a beacon of progress, though some call them isolationists.

nationality_name_nederlandic = Nederlandic
nationality_description_nederlandic = A nation of traders and terraformers. While most sensible nations have expanded to orbital structures, the Nederlandic prefer to settle on planets, no matter how inhospitable, and shape them to their liking. With agriculture driving their economic engines, much of the civilised galaxy enjoys their produce.
