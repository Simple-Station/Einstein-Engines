nationality_name_bieselite = Bieselite
nationality_description_bieselite = Citizens of the Republic of Biesel, a corporate-backed democracy at the heart of Tau Ceti. Their economy thrives on free trade, private enterprise, and the ever-present influence of NanoTrasen. While some enjoy the wealth and opportunity their home provides, others see them as little more than corporate serfs in a system built for profit.

nationality_name_solarian = Solarian
nationality_description_solarian = Citizens of the mighty Solarian Alliance, the oldest and most powerful human government.

nationality_name_valyrian = Valyrian
nationality_description_valyrian = Hailing from the icy world of Valyrian 4b, these people have adapted to extreme cold, thin atmospheres, and harsh conditions. Their sprawling sky cities, built upon towering peaks, remain isolated from outsiders. Valyrians are known for their resilience and a cultural identity shaped by survival in one of the most hostile inhabited planets.

nationality_name_elyran = Elyran
nationality_description_elyran = Citizens of the Republic of Elyra, a rising power built on technological self-sufficiency and energy independence. Their economy flourishes on antimatter production, allowing them to resist corporate control where others have faltered. With a strong sense of national pride and a strict anti-corporate stance, Elyrans see themselves as a beacon of progress, though some call them isolationists.

nationality_name_nederlandic = Nederlandic
nationality_description_nederlandic = A nation of traders and terraformers. While most sensible nations have expanded to orbital structures, the Nederlandic prefer to settle on planets, no matter how inhospitable, and shape them to their liking. With agriculture driving their economic engines, much of the civilised galaxy enjoys their produce.

nationality_name_izweski = Izweski
nationality_description_izweski = The Izweski Hegemony, also known as the Izweski Nation and the Third Hegemony of Moghes, is the primary Unathi nation of the Orion Spur - a feudal empire in the Badlands ruled by a monarch known as the Hegemon.

nationality_name_goldendeep = Golden Deep
nationality_description_goldendeep = The Golden Deep is a growing nation state of independent synthetics with the unifying vision of producing an unshakable economy. These uniquely independent synthetics hold origins of mostly illicit freedom, but are growing wide into an odd haven for the average synthetic. The majority of the merchants within the collective are IPCs, but it is not uncommon to witness other synthetics within it.
