With near-total control over Biesel’s economy and infrastructure, NanoTrasen presents itself as a champion of progress and prosperity—though critics argue it values profit above all else.

employer_name_unemployed = Unemployed
employer_description_unemployed = Whether down on their luck or simply unwilling to work, the unemployed survive however they can. Some live off government subsidies, others turn to freelance work—or less legal alternatives. Either way, society tends to look down on them.

employer_name_hephaestusindustries_command = Hephaestus Industries Command
employer_description_hephaestusindustries = A sprawling manufacturing conglomerate responsible for producing everything from mining drills to military hardware. If it has moving parts, Hephaestus probably made it. Known for their no-nonsense corporate culture and deep ties to industrial and frontier colonies.

employer_name_einsteinengines = Einstein Engines
employer_name_einsteinengines_command = Einstein Engines Command
employer_description_einsteinengines = The galaxy’s premier manufacturer of FTL drives and starship technology. Despite their technical prowess, the company is infamous for harsh working conditions, cutthroat internal politics, and an aggressive legal department that makes their lawsuits as feared as their patents.

employer_name_zenghupharmaceuticals_command = Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals Command

employer_name_cybersun = Cybersun
employer_name_cybersun_command = Cybersun Command
employer_description_cybersun = The public face of the Solarian military-industrial complex and one of the most influential defence contractors in known space.

employer_name_interdyne = Interdyne
employer_name_interdyne_command = Interdyne Command
employer_description_interdyne = A leading name in Solarian biomedical research, cybernetics, and pharmaceutical development. Unlike its competitor Zeng-Hu, Interdyne takes a more pragmatic approach, prioritising efficiency and durability over elegance.

employer_description_idrisincorporated = Idris Incorporated is an interstellar corporate bank headquartered in the Sol Alliance. The bank has begun offering hiring bonuses to those who work for other major interstellar corporations to draw people away from their competitors.

employer_name_orionexpress = Orion Express
employer_name_orionexpress_command = Orion Express Command
employer_description_orionexpress = Orion Express is a manufactured megacorporation designed to handle logistics in the wake of the phoron scarcity, and the sudden entangling of supply lines that left the galaxy struggling for more resources.
