        The Corporate Judo belt is designed to read your body's movements and compel it into the appropriate form to accomplish the desired execution of our patented techniques. Due to the method of implementing this technology with the belt, you will find that you will be unable to use Stun Batons while wearing one. [head=3]
        
        BASIC ATTACK[/head]
        Our First Technique is a simple strike. While it is the least flashy of our programmed maneuvers, it is still quite easy for the untrained to squander its potential with unrefined execution. The belt will ensure all of your strikes are as effective as possible, increasing your ability to disable your opponent faster. To do this you merely need to initiate a single [color=Red][bold]HARM[/bold][/color] action. [head=3]
        
        COMBO ATTACKS[/head]
        The following Techniques are simple enough to replicate, and only require 2-3 actions to perform.[bold]
       
        EYE POKE - [color=MediumBlue]DISARM[/color] -> [color=Red]HARM[/color][/bold]
        This technique temporarily blinds your target, typically for 2-5 seconds at a time, regardless of eye protection. Quite useful as an opener for the other tecnhiques and the blinding has been found to be extendable for upto 30 seconds if you repeat the technique. [bold]
       
        JUDO THROW - [color=Gold]GRAB[/color] -> [color=MediumBlue]DISARM[/color][/bold]
        This technique allows you to throw a standing opponent to the ground, putting them on the ground for roughly 7 seconds on average, allowing a swift and prepared officer to follow up with our next technique and cuff and detain them with ease.[bold]
       
        ARMBAR - [color=MediumBlue]DISARM[/color] -> [color=MediumBlue]DISARM[/color] -> [color=Gold]GRAB[/color][/bold]
        This technique allows you further restrain a difficult individual resisting arrest, even while on the ground. While your target is prone on the ground you can inflict this technique to disarm as well as stun them for roughly 5 seconds as well as inflict enough pain on them to severely hamper their stamina.
        
        With that said, may these techniques serve you well in upholding the tenates and spirit of [bold][italic][color=Red]SPACE LAW[/color][/bold][head=3]
