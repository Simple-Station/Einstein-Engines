        If you are missing any of the items contact your nearest officer or comrade for help.

        Chapter 1.1: Communication

        1. ’:o’ for faction communication.
        2. ’:d’ for close range general communication (500m).
        3. ’;’ for long range general communication (2.5km).

        Chapter 2: Standard Operating Procedures

        1. A mining fleet with escorts will set out to Taypan-1, while several salvage groups will congregate around Nova Balreska or the Tribal Scrapyard.
        2. Research and production operations will commence aboard Port Balreska.
        3. The League will undergo a rearmament procedure and a fleet will be fielded.

        If you don't know what to do, ask on faction radio. There is always work to do.

        Chapter 2.1: Basic Ship Operation

        The NCWL requires many hands to run a fleet. This section will teach you the bare minimum.
        Remember to always listen to your superiors for orders.

        Ship Setup Checklist
        1. Redeem your LPC at a shipyard console.
        2. Swipe your ID at the shuttle console aboard your ship.
        3. Give your comrades access (ID tab).
        4. Load all ship weapons with relevant ammunition and keep a stockpile.
        5. Confirm all crew are ready and undock.
        6. Inform the rest of the League that you are ready, include your ship identifier and class.

        Chapter 2.2 Pilot Doctrine

        You can move with W/A/S/D, turn with Q/E, use your brakes with Space if your ship has fixed guns they will be on labeled buttons on the right of your flight interface.
        Your shuttle console has a range of 256m, your radar console has a range of 1024m, keep both open.
        Use the MAP interface to locate points of interest or scout for vessels out of IFF range.

        You have three engine modes:
        1. Dampen applies a slight amount of drag to your ship, generalist option.
        2. Free removes most drag from your ship, used for specific combat scenarios and long drives.
        3. Anchor applies significant drag to your ship, used for rapid braking and docking.

        1. Keep optimal distance depending on your weapons max range.
        2. Don't expose yourself to unnecessary enemy fire. Always attempt to fire on the enemy.
        3. Pay attention to radio and maintain formation.
        4. Maintain a strong interval between allied vessels, 150-200 meters ensures the maneuverability and safety of the fleet.

        Pilots incapable of executing these instructions will meet their death swiftly if not by the hands of the enemy, but by the hands of their comrades.

        Chapter 2.3 Gunnery Doctrine

        1. Check for targets at the edge of your radar and shuttle console.
        2. Your guns typically exceed the range of your shuttle and radar console, fire from maximal range.
        3. Always lead your shots, aim for the weak points of the enemy, such as engines, guns, thrusters and cockpits.
        4. Prioritize targets that break formation or otherwise expose themselves.

        Chapter 2.4 Loading Doctrine

        A loader's duties are multifaceted, you repair the ship, fend off boarders, replace any missing or dead crew, but most importantly: load the ship's guns.
        Stockpile ammunition close to the relevant shipgun, left click to load/swap mags, coordinate with your gunner and pilot to ensure that all guns are always loaded.
        The crew should always outlive their ship, don't die loading.

        Accelerated Conscript Training manual
        part 2/2

        This manual contains basic procedure for emergency and industry-related activities.
        Make sure to familiarize yourself with part one before moving on.

        Chapter 2.5 Mining basics

        1. Mining is done on an Exhumer or Gazpachov-class vessel in the Taypan-1 or Taypan-2 asteroid belts.
        2. Before going out analyze the situation in the belts with the MAP tab, go out with escorts if the belts aren't safe.
        3. Mine EXCLUSIVELY chromite (purple) and asteroid (light brown) rock formations, asteroids of other types have significantly worse yields.
        4. If you are an escort of a mining party, particularly a Lodka-class, assist the miners in crushing rock with your machineguns if you have spare ammunition.
        5. Return upon meeting a quota of 2 ore boxes per mining ship, or earlier if the situation is too dangerous to continue mining.

        Chapter 2.6 Salvaging basics

        1. Salvaging is done on a Lodka or Kite-class vessel nearby Nova Balreska or in the Tribal Scrapyard.
        2. Before going out analyze the situation in the fields with the MAP tab.
        3. Pick up any pieces of scrap, technology disks, raw materials and everything that poses industrial value, everything else can be discarded.
        4. Use quick-equip (shift+e for beltslot and shift+b for bagslot) hotkeys to rapidly pick up and drop down loot.
        5. Always pay attention to your surroundings, you are a sitting duck while you're salvaging.
        6. Return upon meeting a quota of 5-6 full scrap crates per salvage ship, or earlier if the situation is too dangerous to continue salvaging.

        Chapter 3.1 Emergency Ship Repairs

        Ensure these minimal parts are functional:
        1. Shuttle Console
        2. Gyroscope
        3. Thrusters
        4. Power (See Emergency Power Repairs)

        Sometimes parts can simply be repaired with a screwdriver other times you will need to move things or tear up wiring to make it work.
        If repair is deemed impossible skip to Emergency Bailing.

        Chapter 3.2 Emergency Power Repairs

        Fixing power is very important. Without it no ship can function.
        When fixing the power grid follow these troubleshooting steps.

        1. Confirm a generator is supplying HV.
        2. Confirm a substation is distributing MV.
        3. Confirm an APC is outputting LV.
        4. Fix any broken wires or any damaged equipment as needed, ensure relevant machines have a functional LV cable within 2 tiles of them.

        Generators can be switched to operate on MV if your substation is destroyed.

        Chapter 3.3 Emergency Bailing

        If you cannot repair your ship or deem it too dangerous, consider hiding in space close by to the wreck or in the husk of the ship itself.
        If you need to immediately depart from your ship mid-combat or post-combat, do the following:
        1. Grab your jetpack and mass scanner, use your GPS for coordinate reference.
        2. If you are with a fleet report, to the closest NCWL vessel that you are coming and jetpack over.
        3. If you are alone in space, use your faction comms to call for help, or jetpack to a safe location manually.
        4. Be sure to update your position often and ask for progress.

        Factors such as the following may prevent any and all search and rescue attempts by your comrades:
        1. Forgetting a GPS being unable to call out coordinates.
        2. Forgetting a jetpack or otherwise being unable to conduct maneuvers in space.
        3. Failing to stop your momentum. (A flying comrade is hard to catch)
        4. Dying in the process of recovery to incurred wounds or oxygen loss.

        You can almost always jetpack to a friendly or neutral port with your jetpack, granted you have the relevant coordinates.

        1500, -9000 - Nova Balreska, the primary NCWL outpost in Taypan.

        The following outposts may pose danger:
        0, 0 - Gliess Santo, an independent outpost.
        4000, 2800 - Hayes Medical Waystation, a Coalition-aligned outpost operated by IPM.
        5250, 6600 - Dochenskaya Engineering Outpost, a Coalition-aligned outpost operated by SAW.

        Chapter 3.3 Boarder Defense

        Your radar console will inform you of active mass scanners close to your ship, these often indicate boarder presence.
        Boarders are common after ship combat, as many will opt to try to take over the opposing vessels by force.

        Keep your airlocks closed, especially weak points welded or bolted, always be ready to be greeted by a hostile force and always be prepared to fire back.
        Mechs pose significant threat in infantry combat, shoot down any mech signatures (little triangles) while its possible.
        If boarded by a mech, do not attempt to fight it in single combat without anti-mech weaponry unless the situation calls for it.
