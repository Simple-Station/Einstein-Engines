        [bold]Ship Setup Checklist
        1. Redeem your LPC at a shipyard console.
        2. Swipe your ID at the shuttle console

        4. Load plenty of spare ammunition and ensure all weapons are ready to fire.
        5. Confirm all crew are ready and undock.
        6. Signal using secure communications that you are ready. Be sure to include your ship model and number.[/bold]

        [head=3]Chapter 2.2 Pilot Doctrine[/head]

        You can move with W/A/S/D, turn with Q/E, use your brakes with Space if your ship has fixed guns they will be on labeled buttons on the right of your flight interface.
        If you have a radar console make sure to zoom out as far as possible on that as well and keep both open.
        Use the map interface to look for approaching ships outside of radar range to avoid ambushes.
        Set your damping according to your situation.
        For long range travel use free (no damping)
        For docking use fixed (max damping)
        For most other situations dampen is fine (normal damping)
        As a pilot there are other basic expectations for you such as.
        [bold]
        1. Dont rush the enemy head on unless you have a death wish
        2. Keep optimal distance depending on your weapons
        3. Dodge enemy fire! Every hit you take costs you.
        4. Follow orders and dont split formation.[/bold]

        Breaking any of these will be followed by punishment on the off chance you survive.

        If you die it could lead to your whole fleet’s death.

        [head=3]Chapter 2.3 Gunnery Doctrine[/head]

        Your job is to lay fire with the intention to protect the communard.
        Remember keeping the guns firing keeps the morale high so start firing the moment you are in range!
        Leading your shots is a skill you will learn over time but keep firing no matter what.
        Your guns have plenty of range! You dont need to actually see what you are shooting at.
        Their radar is signature on the edge of your screen is enough.
        If you have a radar console make sure to zoom out as far as possible on that as well and keep both open.
        Any bullet that goes unfired is a bullet that could have been shot into Imperial scum!
        Here is a basic guide for engaging targets.
        [bold]
        1. See targets on the edge of your radar.
        2. Check distance to target.
        3. When in range start firing and dont stop firing.
        4. Do not advance from your effective range unless you’ve been told to.
        4. Achieve glorious victory

        [head=3]Chapter 2.4 Loading Doctrine[/head]

        As a loader keeping your guns loaded is a promise to the people!
        Every moment a gun runs dry is a moment that you could have prevented.
        Prepare ammunition close to the matching weapon system. Left click to load/swap mags.
        Reload some guns early such as needlers as the mags can be combined.
        Keep yourself safe! A dead loader is an useless loader!

        [bold]Attention! Only proceed after reading part 1![/bold]

        [head=3]Chapter 2.5 Mining basics[/head]

        Mining isn't just a job its the communard’s way of life.
        You go to an asteroid belt (Taypan 1 usually) and use your exhumer and ore magnet to collect ore.
        You just need to get close to the asteroid and blast it to pieces.
        Be sure to return in one piece comrade!
        Without workers the revolution is useless!

        [head=2]Chapter 3 Emergency Procedures[/head]

        This section is the difference between life and death in this sector. Every emergency is different but dealing with it effectively and quickly is of highest importance!
        The communard values you alive.

        [head=3]Chapter 3.1 Emergency Ship Repairs[/head]

        This chapter is about saving a ship that has become inoperable by any means.
        [bold]
        Ensure these minimal parts are functional.

        1. Shuttle Console
        2. Gyroscope
        3. Thruster (at least 1)
        4. Power (See Emergency Power Repairs)[/bold]

        Sometimes parts can simply be repaired with a screwdriver other times you will need to move thing or tear up wiring to make it work.
        If repair is deemed impossible skip to Emergency Bailing.

        [head=3]Chapter 3.2 Emergency Power Repairs[/head]

        Fixing power is very important. Without it no ship can function.
        When fixing the power grid follow these troubleshooting steps.
        [bold]
        1. Confirm a generator is supplying HV.
        2. Confirm a substation is distributing MV.
        3. Confirm an APC is outputting LV.
        4. Fix any broken wires or any damaged equipment as needed.

        Generators can be switched to operate on MV if your substation is destroyed. [/bold]

        [head=3]Chapter 3.3 Emergency Bailing[/head]

        Remember sometimes staying on your ship and calling for help might be smart choice even if its a husk.
        If you need to EVA follow this guide.
        Grab your jetpack,mass scanner and GPS.
        If you are with a fleet report to the closest NCWL vessel that you are coming and jetpack over.
        If you are alone in space use your faction comms to call for help.
        Be sure to update your position often and ask for progress.

        There are many factors that can make a rescue impossible all coming from failing to follow NCWL protocol such as
        [bold]
        1. Forgetting a GPS being unable to call out coordinates.
        2. Forgetting a jetpack being unable to manouever.
        3. Failing to stop your momentum. (A flying comrade is hard to catch)
        4. Not having sufficient air supplies.[/bold]

        If within reach attempting to move to any of these places is an option to.
        Notable coordinates:
        0:0 Gliess Santo (Neutral spacer outpost)
        2000:-8000 Balreska

        [head=3]Chapter 3.3 Boarder Defense[/head]

        Your radar console will be warning you in regards to closeby mass scanners.
        Noticing boarders is very important as they can single handedly disable ships.
        Always carry a firearm by your side.
        If you are boarded by a mech then be extra careful.
        If possible fight with your crew to overwhelm the boarders but avoid friendly fire.
        Use your access to hide behind doors and use corridors to concentrate fire!

        [head=2]Closing notes[/head]

        Comrade you are part of something bigger than just yourself.
        Remember to work for the good of the collective rather than yourself.
        Distribute this guide to your fellow crew and remember it by heart!
        Dont die in vain!
