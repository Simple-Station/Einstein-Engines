# All maps marked as De-rotated are currently receiving no update support due to a shortage of map maintainers.
# If you want to see these maps return to official rotation, and have any talent with mapping, please feel free to get in contact with Old Dance Jacket.
# We have a mapping server where we can support arbitrarily any number of people wishing to cooperatively map together. Alternatively, you can
# choose to support a map solo.

# We do this because these maps have not received any updates in over a year, and our efforts to find people willing to maintain these maps have gone
# largely unanswered. As a result, we can't guarantee their quality at all.

# In order to make re-rotate a map, please submit a PR providing at least some amount of work to refurbish the map you wish to reintroduce. It doesn't even
# need to be a full comprehensive rework. Maybe like... Rework a department. Add an AI Satellite. Add decorative details. Do *something* cool.
# Show us that someone actually cares about the map enough to make it something people actually want to play on.
