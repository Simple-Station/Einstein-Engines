  description: In order to reduce material waste, this shield is made primarily out of layered, hardened plastics that allows League enforcers to endure thrown rocks, molotovs, hurled insults from riotous proles, small calibre pistol rounds and even stern rebukes from their own Kommissar. Someone clever has carved "THIS SIDE TOWARD YOU" on the inside.
