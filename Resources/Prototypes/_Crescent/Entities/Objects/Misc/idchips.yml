  description: A Pre-Collapse identification chip inserted subdermally near the brainstem. Records every piece of information possible about the holder and primarily used for gate-to-gate travel before the Bluespace Collapse. Nowadays, they've been repurposed as digital passports. This one's registered to a known low-risk criminal. You could probably make some scratch turning it in at a bounty office.

  description: A Pre-Collapse identification chip inserted subdermally near the brainstem. Records every piece of information possible about the holder and primarily used for gate-to-gate travel before the Bluespace Collapse. Nowadays, they've been repurposed as digital passports. This one has been smashed beyond repair and contaminated with Abyssal materials. Being a proof of kill for an Abyssal beast, it should sell nicely at a bounty post.
