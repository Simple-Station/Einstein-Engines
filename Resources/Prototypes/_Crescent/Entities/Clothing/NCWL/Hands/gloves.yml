  description: A pair of long crimson gloves traditionally worn by Majors during parades, tribunals, and “diplomatic visits.” The material feels expensive, thick satin that hides kevlar-fiber beneath. Ceremony without function is anathema to the League. A bit posh for a Polarist, one might mutter under their breath. But never aloud.
