  name: NCWL Grishingrad
  description: The Grishingrad, a heavily armed and armored luxury boat based on old designs from Chengdrdiz. The base hull was originally a seized Imperial party vessel, spared from the scrap heap and its fate of being melted into war material. Instead, at the request of a certain Admiral, it was towed into the Iron Ring Company’s docks and rebuilt with more personal specs in mind.
