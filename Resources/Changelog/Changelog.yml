        1984'd most instances of "Unobtainium" chemistry. Chems like Necrosol
        that previously required normally unobtainable reagents such as
        Cognizine or Vestine now instead have long production chains of chems
        that are obtainable, but complicated to produce. Check the chemistry
        menu for more information.

        Made Arsenal Research significantly more interesting by consolidating
        most of the useless single item researches into larger essential
        categories. Basic Weapons, Advanced Weapons, Prototype Weapons. Going
        forwards, these three categories will have significantly more exciting
        options added to them that should make it more worthwhile to pursue.

        Research is now "Softcapped" by Tier 3 unlocks. Each unlocked Tier 3
        technology multiplicatively increases the cost of all other research.
        Rushing a capstone can be quite expensive, as will be getting multiple
        capstones. I hope you're glad that you can build more than one prober
        now without guaranteeing the station will explode.
